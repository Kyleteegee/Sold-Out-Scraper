# Sold-Out-Scraper

======== Purpose:========
This code is meant to frequently check the status of the 'Sold Out' button found on shopping sites targeted specifically towards Electronic/Gaming sites, or big box retailers that have an adequate electronics section. Should you want to use this for a non-electronics products on a big box retailer website, this should work just fine. This is NOT a purchasing bot, nor do I encourage the use of developing one given the context of the current times (2020 holidays with Covid-19, heavy scalping,etc.). I am personally using this to gain an advantage to auto-refreshers and just generally people that have way more time than I do to stalk store pages for product drops so that I may manually purchase whichever item I'm looking for during manufacturing shortages after being alerted.


Each site has different html to describe Sold-Out/Add-To-Cart buttons, so the html identifiers are hard-coded for each site. Since html is subject to change, multiple functions of this are subject to errors and the potential for multiple fixes. If you run into these, please raise an issue and I'll get to it when I can.


====== About My Experience ======
While I have made small scripts sporadically over the past few years, I am still pretty new to more intermediate/advanced programming techniques/concepts. I've only ever coded by myself, for myself. Having said that, I'm trying to learn to use GitHub and to hopefully learn some more intermediate and advanced techniques. If you see some major flaws or even something minor like bad practices, please let me know. I'm open to all criticisms.
