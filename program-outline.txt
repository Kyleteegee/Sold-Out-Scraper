main loop outline-

This code is specifically used for out of stock items.

main():

	out_of_stock = True
	while out_of_stock:
		*gather all html from all supplied URLs
				- make base website of URL identifiable so multiple sites can be listed but processed differently
				- implement async so page requests aren't blocking to speed up large lists of URLs
				- scatter the timing of page requests to respect website requests + limit unintentional locking during html request
				- implement the scatter timing in relation to number of URLs provided along with etiquette of limited page requests per website
				- handle timeout exceptions to be skipped and tried again during the next html request
				- request limit: request_per_second = 1 for each website per second( 3 best buy = 1 per second, 1 bestbuy+ 1 target + 1 newegg = 3 per second)
				
		Convert html to soup (BS4)
		
		*Check soup for sold out button
				- if not sold_out:
							open_url
							some kind of alert, via sms/voice call/audio playback
							start loop over without using last url
